[Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) poses challenges to solve.

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill". Advent of Code provides a wide variety of challenges and it is a great way to learn a new programming language by diving down into the implementation of a problem and learning the syntax as you go.

I strive to embrace a functional orientated approach to solving all of the challenges in this year's challenges using JavaScript.
